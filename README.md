# Slice-Up
Documentation and Utilities for the Slice-Up project

The documentation will be also published on https://discourse.sliceup-3d.com

This repository will collect all of documentation published about the Slice-Up project.

It is planned to include a set of grasshopper utilities, that can help prepare .3dm files that can be processed by Slice-Up tools.

It would be great to include a similar set of utilities for blender geometry nodes.
