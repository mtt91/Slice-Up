# How to work with multiple walls

One perk of Slice-Up is that it can generate a continuous tool-path for multiple walls.

> **NOTE:** from now on I will refer to multiple walls object as `multiObject`, while we will call each wall  a `loop`

In this tutorial I will show a bit of the general work-flow of working with multiple walls. Specifically, I am going to detail:

- How to create `multiObjects`
- How to modify `multiObjects`

In order to simplify visualization, in the examples I will use a layer height of 10mm.
Here are the example files we will use:

### Creating multiObjects
Multi objects are created using the `Offset` module.

> **NOTE:** you can add up to three offset loops to your original wall, which means that you can create objects with up to 4 walls.

>**NOTE:** All loops will be automatically sorted outside in, so you donâ€™t need to worry about the order when using multiple loop.

General offset rules: 
- Negative values offset to the outside
- Positive values offset to the inside
- For `loops` you can either set an independent distance, or repeat the first `loop` offset. 

Let's see an example:

First we set a `offset distance` equal to the extrusion width for the `first loop`. This will create a thicker wall.

Next, we select `New Loop` in the `Second Loop` tab and set a negative value for the `Offset Distance`. This will make our object wider.

Finally, we select `Repeat first Loop`duplicate the first offset in the `Third loop`. This will copy the very first offset, so to also make the outer wall thicker.

### Offset and Waves

>**WARNING:** wave offset is a `loose offset`. It does not strictly respect the offset distance at all points in the path. This can be more or less of a problem depending on your design and/or print technology, so plan accordingly.

When importing `waves` in the offset module you can choose to force it to use `primary curves`. If you do this, the new loop looses its `wave` structure.

Let's consider the some examples:

Here is a simple offset that double the wall thicknes, you can notice it is loose.

Here we force the offset to a `primary copy` in order to obtain a smooth finish on the inside while having a wave structure on the outside.

Finally, we create a new `loop` that is also forced to use the `primary copy`.
This way, we will keep the original wave structure stays in between two smooth  walls.

### Further modifying multi-objects
Once you created a `multiObject` you can export it and continue to work on it as usual.

>**WARNING:**  You can not import a `multiObject` into the `Offset ` module, the `Combine` module or the `Spiral` module. If you do, you will get a error message. 

>**NOTE:** when modifying a `multiObject` you can only work on one `loop` at the time.

Upon import of a `multiObject`:
- Make sure to toggle `show input` in the `Display tab`. This will allow you to see all the `loops` as a reference.
- Select the desired `loop` in the `I/O tab`
- Exporting will export the entire `multiObject`, but it will replace the `loop` you just worked on.

>**TIP:** you can quickly modify different `loops` by exporting and  re-importing while switching `loops` in the process.

### Applying transformations
The same general workflow applies when importing into `Transform`. In the following example the a `scale` function is used to modify the shape of the outer wall:

When applying  rotations to a `multiObject` you must pay extra attention to the seam location. 

>**WARNING:** applying a rotation to a single loop will result a mismatch between the seams

In this example we apply a 90 degree rotation to the middle loop, and you can see how the seams on different loops (white) remain unchanged:

To avoid this problem, you can either apply the same rotation to all loops recursively, or you can apply the rotation before using the `Offset` module. The latter is showed in this example:

### Multi-ojects and baseFill

In order to build a base for a multi-wall object, simply import it into the `baseFill` module. The outer `loop` will be automaticaly selected and you can proceed as usual.

### Generating gcode

In order to generate gcode for a `multiObject` you must use the `Multi` red module, and pay particular attention to the parameters that control the seam.

[Here](https://discourse.sliceup-3d.com/t/generating-gcode/20) you can find some general information about generating the gcode.

Hope this helped!
